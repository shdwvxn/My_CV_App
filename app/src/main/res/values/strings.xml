    <string name="about_favs">I love reading books, and two of my favorites are No Longer Human and Thicker Than Blood. No Longer Human delves into the struggles of a man grappling with his identity and place in society, offering a profound and introspective narrative. Thicker Than Blood captivates with its intense exploration of family bonds, loyalty, and the complexities of human relationships. Both books leave a lasting impact with their compelling stories and deep themes.</string>
    <string name="my_anime">Anime is a popular form of Japanese animation known for its vibrant art, engaging storylines, and diverse genres. Two of my favorite anime are Blue Lock and JoJo\'s Bizarre Adventure. Blue Lock is a thrilling sports anime about young soccer players competing to become the best striker in Japan. The intense competition and character development make it a captivating watch. JoJo\'s Bizarre Adventure follows the Joestar family across generations as they battle supernatural foes with their Stand abilities. Its imaginative storylines and memorable characters make it a standout in the anime world.</string>
